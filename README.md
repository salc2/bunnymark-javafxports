# JavaFX Bunnymark - A JavaFXPorts Bunny Benchmark

This is just a quick first try of JavaFX in general not only JavaFXPorts, this bunnymark was inspired on `PIXI.js` bunny benchmark.
Click or touch the screen to add more bunnies.
>Apologies for the code, it was just following instincts. No standards, no best practices of the API but I'm quite inspired to keep playing with it, so it's time to study the documentation properly I guess. 
>Enjoy =)
